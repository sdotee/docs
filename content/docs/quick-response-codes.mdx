<Callout type="info">
**Tip:** For QR codes created on this page, you can quickly access the QR code image by appending `/qr.png`, `/qr.svg`, or `/qr.pdf` to the short URL. For example, if your QR code short URL is `https://s.ee/sZvL`, you can access:
- `https://s.ee/sZvL/qr.png` - PNG image
- `https://s.ee/sZvL/qr.svg` - SVG vector
- `https://s.ee/sZvL/qr.pdf` - PDF document

**Note:** This feature only works for dynamic QR codes created in the [QR Codes](https://s.ee/user/qr/) section, not for regular short links.

## Analytics

QR codes include the same analytics as links:

- Scan counts
- Location data
- Device information
- Referrer sources

---

## Best Practices

- Use high contrast colors for better scanning
- Keep logos small to maintain scannability
- Test your QR code before printing
