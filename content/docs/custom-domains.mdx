## What is a Custom Domain?

A custom domain lets you use your own brand in short links instead of `s.ee`. For example, instead of `s.ee/link`, you could use `go.example.com/link`.

---

## Why Use a Custom Domain?

- **Brand recognition** - Links display your brand, not ours
- **Trust** - Users are more likely to click branded links
- **Higher click-through rates** - Branded links perform better

---

## Add a Custom Domain

1. Go to [https://s.ee/user/domains/](https://s.ee/user/domains/)
2. Click **Add Domain**
3. Enter your domain name
4. Add the required DNS records:
   - **TXT record** - For domain verification
   - **CNAME or Alias record** - To point your domain to S.EE
5. Wait for DNS propagation (usually a few minutes)
6. Click **Verify** to confirm setup

---

## Requirements

- Domain must be different from your main website domain
- Maximum 63 characters (including the dot)
- You must have access to your domain's DNS settings

## Important Notes

### Cloudflare Users

If you're using Cloudflare for DNS, **do not enable the Proxy (orange cloud icon)** for your CNAME record. Keep it in DNS-only mode (gray cloud). Enabling Cloudflare proxy may cause CDN conflicts and redirect issues.

### Using a Naked Domain (Root Domain)

If you want to use a naked domain (e.g., `example.com` instead of `go.example.com`), your DNS provider must support **ALIAS records** or **CNAME flattening**. Common providers with this feature:

- [Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/cname-flattening/) (CNAME flattening)
- [Hurricane Electric](https://dns.he.net/) (CNAME)
- [DNSimple](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/alias-record-reference/) (ALIAS)
- [DNS Made Easy](https://dnsmadeeasy.com/aname-records) (ANAME)
- [ClouDNS](https://www.cloudns.net/wiki/article/18/) (ALIAS)

If your DNS provider doesn't support these features, please [contact us](https://s.ee/contact/) - we can help verify and add your naked domain manually.
