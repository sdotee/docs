## MCP Server

For AI/LLM integrations, use our MCP (Model Context Protocol) server:

- [sdotee/cli-mcp-server](https://github.com/sdotee/cli-mcp-server)

### Features

- **URL Management**: Create, update, delete, and list domains for short URLs
- **Content Sharing**: Share code snippets and text with expiration and password protection
- **File Operations**: Upload and delete files
- **Time Utilities**: Access current time information with timezone support

### Requirements

- Go 1.25+
- Valid S.EE API Key

### Build

```bash
# Using Makefile (current OS)
make build

# Build for all platforms
make build-all

# Or using Go directly
go build -o bin/cli-mcp-server .
```

### Run

```bash
./bin/cli-mcp-server -api-key "your-api-key"
```

You can also set the API key via environment variable:

```bash
export SEE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
./bin/cli-mcp-server
```

The server defaults to port 30101 and uses Server-Sent Events for MCP connections. Configure the MCP server URL in your LLM client settings (e.g., Cherry Studio) to integrate.
