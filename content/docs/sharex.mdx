[ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) is an open-source screen capture and file sharing tool for Windows. S.EE provides custom uploader configs for ShareX, so you can upload screenshots, files, text, and code directly to S.EE and get a shareable link back.

## Usage

### Pick your uploaders

In ShareX, go to **Destinations** and assign the S.EE uploaders:

- URL shortener → S.EE URL Shortener
- Text uploader → S.EE Text Uploader, Code Uploader, or Markdown Uploader
- Image uploader → S.EE File Uploader
- File uploader → S.EE File Uploader

### Upload

Use the ShareX hotkeys or right-click menu to shorten a URL, upload a screenshot, share a text snippet, etc. ShareX uploads to S.EE and copies the link to your clipboard.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| 401 error | Check that your API key is set correctly in the Authorization header |
| 403 error | Make sure your API key has the right permissions |
| File rejected | The file type might not be supported. See [File Sharing](/docs/file-sharing) for allowed types |

You can click **Test** in **Custom uploader settings** to verify everything works.
