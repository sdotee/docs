description: Use S.EE with any YOURLS-compatible client or integration
icon: PlugZap
---

S.EE provides a YOURLS-compatible API endpoint, allowing you to use S.EE with existing third-party clients and integrations that support the [YOURLS](https://yourls.org/) API.

This endpoint is designed to ease migration from YOURLS or to integrate S.EE into automation tools, browser extensions, and applications that already speak the YOURLS API protocol.

---

## API Endpoint

```
https://s.ee/api/v1/yourls
````

---

## Compatibility Scope

This endpoint implements a **partial YOURLS API compatibility layer**.

### Supported

- `action=shorturl`
- `signature` authentication
- Output formats: `json`, `jsonp`, `xml`, `simple`
- GET and POST requests

### Not Supported

- `username` / `password` authentication
- Other YOURLS actions such as `expand`, `stats`, or `db-stats`
- Administrative or database-related operations

Only the URL shortening functionality is provided.

---

## Authentication

<Callout type="warn">
Only `signature` authentication is supported. Username/password authentication is **not** available.
</Callout>

The `signature` parameter is your **S.EE API Token**.

You can generate and manage your API token at:

https://s.ee/user/developers/

The API token is scoped to the authenticated user and inherits the same permissions and restrictions as the account.

---

## Supported Actions

Currently, only the following action is supported:

| Action | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `shorturl` | Create a short URL for a given link |

---

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `signature` | Yes | Your S.EE API Token |
| `action` | Yes | The action to perform (currently only `shorturl`) |
| `url` | Yes | The URL to shorten |
| `format` | No | Output format: `json`, `jsonp`, `xml`, or `simple` (default: `simple`) |
| `keyword` | No | Custom slug for the short URL |
| `title` | No | Title for the short URL |

### Notes

- If a provided `keyword` is already in use, the API will automatically generate a new available keyword instead of returning an error.
- Standard S.EE abuse prevention and validation rules apply to all requests.

## Examples

### POST Request

```bash
curl -X POST \
  'https://s.ee/api/v1/yourls' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data-urlencode 'signature=your_api_token' \
  --data-urlencode 'format=json' \
  --data-urlencode 'action=shorturl' \
  --data-urlencode 'url=https://example.com/'
````

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "code": "",
  "message": "https://example.com/ added to database",
  "errorCode": "",
  "statusCode": "200",
  "url": {
    "keyword": "link",
    "url": "https://example.com/",
    "title": "",
    "date": "2026-01-14 21:38:10",
    "ip": "192.0.2.2"
  },
  "shorturl": "https://s.ee/link"
}
```

<Callout>
Some response fields are preserved for YOURLS compatibility and may be empty.
</Callout>

---

### GET Request

```bash
curl -X GET "https://s.ee/api/v1/yourls?action=shorturl&format=simple&signature=your_api_token&url=https://example.com/"
```

**Response:**

```
https://s.ee/link
```

<Callout>
Remember to URL-encode parameters when using GET requests.  
For long URLs or additional parameters, POST requests are recommended to avoid URL length limits.
</Callout>
