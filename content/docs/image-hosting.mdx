The [image upload page](https://s.ee/user/images/) handles bulk image uploads. Drag and drop files or folders, paste from your clipboard, or click to pick files. Pasted images are automatically converted to WebP (or PNG if your browser doesn't support WebP).

Uploaded files are sorted by filename, so batches stay in order.

## Share codes

Each image gets a share link. You can copy links one at a time or grab a share code for the whole batch.

Formats: Direct URL, Markdown, HTML, BBCode.

---

## Managing files

The image page is upload-only. To delete images or manage files, go to [s.ee/user/files/](https://s.ee/user/files/).
