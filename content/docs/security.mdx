At S.EE, security and abuse prevention are core parts of how we operate the service.

As a URL shortening platform, we host and redirect links at scale—and that comes with responsibility. The same security and anti-abuse principles apply to all S.EE sharing features, including short links, text sharing, and file sharing.

This document explains the measures we take to prevent phishing, malware distribution, and abusive behavior, while respecting user privacy.

## Proactive Abuse Prevention

### Threat Database Updates

We proactively block known abusive content by maintaining an internal blocklist that is updated daily using multiple reputable community-maintained sources, including:

* Disposable and temporary email domain databases
* Public phishing and scam URL datasets
* Domain lists associated with adult or high-risk abuse content

These datasets are used to prevent the creation of content that is known to be malicious or commonly abused.

---

### No Free or Trial Accounts

S.EE does not offer free accounts or trial access.

Requiring paid accounts significantly raises the cost of abuse and discourages large-scale automated misuse, which is one of the most effective ways to reduce phishing and spam activity on sharing platforms.

---

### Platform Registration and Domain Reputation

The `s.ee` domain is registered and declared as an official short-link domain across major platforms and security ecosystems.

This helps prevent impersonation, reduces false positives in automated moderation systems, and enables faster resolution if a platform or provider flags content for review.

---

## Content Creation Safeguards

### Real-Time URL Checks

When a user creates a short link, the destination URL is checked in real time against our internal abuse and phishing detection systems.

Links that match known malicious patterns or blocklisted targets are blocked before they can be published.

---

### Rate Limiting and Behavior Monitoring

To prevent automated or abusive behavior:

* Content creation is subject to per-account rate limits
* Unusual activity patterns, such as rapid bulk slug creation, may trigger manual review
* High-risk regions are subject to additional safeguards

These controls help protect the platform without affecting normal users.

---

## Text and File Sharing Safeguards

Text and file sharing features on S.EE are subject to the same abuse prevention and enforcement standards as short links.

Shared content may be reviewed or restricted if it is found to:

* Distribute malware or malicious payloads
* Facilitate phishing, scams, or social engineering
* Violate applicable laws or our Acceptable Use Policy

Where necessary, shared text or files may be disabled or removed, and associated accounts may be reviewed or suspended following manual verification.

---

## Ongoing Monitoring and Enforcement

### Retroactive Content Disabling

Abuse detection does not stop at the time content is created.

If a short link, shared text, or file is later identified as malicious, deceptive, or in violation of our policies, it may be disabled retroactively, even if it was previously allowed.

---

### Manual Review and Human Oversight

User reports and internal alerts are reviewed by a human moderator.

If abuse is confirmed after review, we may:

* Disable the affected content
* Suspend or terminate the associated account
* Take additional action as required by our policies
