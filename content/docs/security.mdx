description: How S.EE prevents phishing, malware, and abuse across short links, text sharing, and file sharing.
icon: ShieldCheck
---

S.EE is a URL shortener that redirects links at scale. We take that seriously. Everything described here applies equally to short links, text sharing, and file sharing.

---

## Abuse prevention

### Blocklists

We maintain an internal blocklist, updated daily from community-maintained sources:

* Disposable and temporary email domain databases
* Public phishing and scam URL datasets
* Domain lists associated with adult or high-risk content

Known malicious content is blocked before it can be created.

---

### No free accounts

S.EE doesn't offer free accounts or trial access. Requiring payment raises the cost of abuse and makes large-scale automated misuse impractical.

---

### Domain reputation

The `s.ee` domain is registered as an official short-link domain across major platforms and security ecosystems. This reduces false positives in automated moderation and speeds up resolution when content is flagged.

---

## Content creation checks

### Real-time URL scanning

When someone creates a short link, the destination URL is checked against our abuse and phishing detection systems in real time. Links matching known malicious patterns are blocked.

---

### Rate limiting

* Content creation has per-account rate limits
* Unusual patterns (like rapid bulk slug creation) can trigger manual review
* High-risk regions have additional safeguards

---

## Text and file sharing

Text and file sharing follow the same rules as short links. Content may be restricted or removed if it:

* Distributes malware
* Facilitates phishing, scams, or social engineering
* Violates applicable laws or our [Acceptable Use Policy](https://s.ee/aup/)

Accounts tied to violations may be suspended after manual review.

---

## Monitoring and enforcement

### Retroactive disabling

If a link, text, or file is later found to be malicious or deceptive, we disable it, even if it passed checks when it was created.

---

### Human review

User reports and internal alerts go to a human moderator. If abuse is confirmed, we disable the content and may suspend or terminate the account.

---

## Reporting abuse
